## Pi compatibility

- This skill runs inside **Pi**, not the Hermes agent runtime. Use only tools actually declared in the current session.
- Resolve bundled scripts, templates, assets and reference paths relative to this `SKILL.md` directory. Preserve their contents and CLI syntax.
- Pi tool argument examples: `read({"path":"/absolute/file"})`, `write({"path":"/absolute/file","content":"..."})`, `bash({"command":"..."})`. Use `edit` for precise changes to existing files.
- Shell/Python/JavaScript code should run through `bash` using the appropriate interpreter; `execute_code` is not a default Pi tool. Do not pass natural-language pseudocode to an interpreter.
- Check prerequisites before running commands. Copying this skill does not install its CLIs, enable external services, or provide API keys.
- Source compatibility has been adapted, but runtime behavior and third-party dependencies have **not** been tested.
